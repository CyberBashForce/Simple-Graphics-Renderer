A basic OpenGL graphics renderer in C++ that demonstrates how computer graphics work by rendering a pink triangle.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone "https://github.com/CyberBashForce/Simple-Graphics-Renderer.git"

### 2. Add Library Paths

    Add the include folder to your IDE's Include Directories.
    Add the lib folder to your IDE's Library Directories.

### 3. Place glad.c in the Same Directory as main.cpp

Ensure the `glad.c` file is located with main.cpp.

### 4. Compile the Program

For Visual Studio or your IDE, ensure you link the following libraries:

    glfw3.lib
    opengl32.lib

### 5. Run the Executable

Once compiled, run the executable to see a pink triangle in a window.
Precompiled Executable

A precompiled executable is available in the `Pre Compiled` folder.
Troubleshooting

  1) Ensure all libraries are linked correctly.
  2) Double-check library paths.
  3) Make sure OpenGL drivers are installed.
